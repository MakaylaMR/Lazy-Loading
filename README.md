# Web Design Tools & Techniques (CPNT-201)

## Description
This repo demonstrates the use of lazy loading, height and width, the srcset attribute and file size. For the purpose of this activity, I have made the images distinctly different so it is more obvious to see when the smaller/bigger image comes into place. 

The large (lg) image is black and white/ unsaturated, the medium (md) image is coloured and consists of the background completely blurred, and the small (sm) image has a RGB split filter. All the images have the same dimensions; lg: 1920x1280, md: 1024x683, sm: 500x333. All of these adjustments have been done using [Pixlr E](https://pixlr.com/e/).

The images also have a file size of 100kB or lower, this was done using [Squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/).
